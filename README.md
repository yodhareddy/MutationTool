# MutationTool

Any Application could be tested using test case. If the application passes all the test cases, it is considered safe. However, how can we know the testsuite consists of enough test cases?
So, Mutation Testing Tool is used to test the efficiency of available test suite for given application.
This tool is written in java and accepts java application with JUnit Test Cases as input.
Tool creates different Mutants and tests the efficiency of test cases. 
Final output would be the efficiency of test suite.
